## **THE JOURNEY AND WHY**  
From working in the NYC Real Estate market to big law and luxury event planning to a global financial services provider, I paused often amongst the crazed and high-pressure days to ask myself, “what’s the point?” Through a deep exploration and personal journey (that I continue to be on), I finally woke up to realize, everything matters. Your word and who you are for yourself and others. 

Leaders and stakeholders carry the brunt of the pressure on their shoulders. Forced to choose between their day job and critical systemic gaps, the pressure is on and the machine isn’t set up to win.  
To reach their goals, they delegate tasks and assign targets, providing clarity and direction to teams for execution, as well as metrics for how they will be measured

- **Stakeholders are faced with roadblocks, and without resolution, can be detrimental to their success:**  
  * **“Good enough” isn’t enough.** Revenue targets are either falling short or leaving growth on the table – competitors are gaining ground  
  * **Leadership stretched thin.** Top performers promoted for individual success now juggle untrained leadership duties – leaving less time for individual contribution, to grow teams and drive revenue  
  * **Talent at risk.** Without investment in development and engagement, burnout and turnover rise – your best people walk away, taking your investment with them  
- **Employees are frustrated and / or limited. The compounding effect builds into explosive resentment, complacency or jumping ship, to yet another hamster wheel. – CONSOLDIATE FEEDBACK**  
- **Question:** If the key to performing your best is to surrender the outcome, how is a leader to balance hitting goals and getting their employees to perform at their highest potential?  
  * Help them “off the field” Give employees a safe space to be vulnerable and get the help they need to operate as and grow into the best version of themselves.

We tend to operate in survival mode. Because, well, it’s thought to be the fastest solution; and let’s face it, most egos don’t want to open the kimono and ask for help. And even more preposterous, you can’t tell someone to get help. In our current environment, “self-help” continues to reek of weakness.   
We’ve made strides and yet the most powerful industries and institutions have not fully embedded the practice and prioritization of mental health into its DNA, though it is what makes up the very DNA of their greatest assets, their people and their psyche.   
It’s important to recognize and acknowledge another major barrier here. It can be argued, more often than not, that self-growth and transformation are not wanted. Most people want to be heard, loved and appreciated. **So, how can we close that gap?**  
**“Greatness isn’t for the chosen few, it’s for the few who choose it”**   
– Joshua Medcalf, Author of “Chop Wood Carry Water”  
Through studies and evident in the performance of the world’s greatest leaders and legends, it is crystal clear that greatness is rarely (if ever) achieved solo. Athletes, artists, business innovators, and stars alike, have partnered with one, two or even many resources not because they’re not good enough, but because they want to be the best. Relentless self-discipline, growth mindset and coachability, and unshakeable purpose and inner drive – We’ve heard countless stories on what it takes for the Greats to be legendary. What we haven’t heard enough about is their ecosystem that unlocked their potential.  
Inspiration 

**WHY: Video / Sizzle**  
**CHANCE FAVORS THE PREPARED MIND**

1. **SUICIDE IS HAPPENING RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE, AND YOU CAN BE THE ONE TO STOP IT**

No one needs to hear another story about a wildly wealthy portfolio manager, husband and father to four children, who took his life because he lacked outlets; and vices were no longer numbing the pain enough.  
**OBVIOUSLY,** significant earnings come with immense and intense pressure. While it’s unavoidable, the challenges that come with it don’t need to be unattended to. Emotions can be tamed and suppressed, but the sensations cannot. Mental health is innately a major contributing factor to physical health and one’s ability to perform. 

*Visual: Man standing on edge of building looking down with his life below him; ready to jump to his death. His “riches” (children, his wife, parents, his multiple homes (suburbs, beach house, ski house, nice cars, country club), his career (employer, stacked wealth, clients, colleagues). Above him, weighing down from the clouds above illustrate the pain and pressures: deteriorating physical health problems (blood pressure, cholesterol, anxiety, medications, exhaustion). Illustrate how life is passing by without the proper tools to navigate and handle the demands and pressure.*

2. **PUSH BACK ON SOCIETAL NORMS, BE THE ROCKAFELLER, MLK JR, VANDERBILT. BE THE LEADER WHO CREATES THE SHIFT.**

   **John D. Rockefeller**  
   He defied the norms of scattered industry and inefficiency, creating an empire that revolutionized business structure and scale. Rockefeller didn’t follow the system—he built a new one.

   **Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.**  
   He stood against the entrenched norms of racial segregation and injustice, challenging the conscience of a nation. Through vision, courage, and relentless advocacy, he reshaped civil rights in America.

   **Cornelius Vanderbilt**  
   He disrupted the established order of transportation, turning chaos into control and inefficiency into empire. Vanderbilt didn’t wait for permission—he moved the economy forward on his terms.

*Visual: Similar to Mount Rushmore and include their hands to show a play on words or how they moved mountains to make dreams become reality. For each person, illustrate the story being told in the sentence: their arms and hands using strength to bring their creation to life.*

3. **WE DON’T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE FUNCTIONALITY AND OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT RUN OUR VERY EXISTENCE AS AN INDIVIDUAL.**

**HOW IS IT THAT WE DON’T TAKE THE TIME TO LEARN HOW TO OPERATE THE HEAVIEST AND MOST POWERFUL PIECE OF MACHINERY WE DRIVE?** 

Understanding the operating system of anything is essential—because when you know how it functions, where it excels, and where it breaks down, you can unlock its full potential, mitigate risks, and drive consistent, high-level performance.

No pilot flies millions safely without mastering the unique design and quirks of their plane—knowing how it handles stress and what to do when things go wrong.

No surgeon delivers top care without understanding that every body is different—adapting to each patient’s unique anatomy and response.

No engineer builds safe, high-performing machines without knowing every part’s role and how each model’s design shapes its limits.

Mastery demands deep knowledge of the specific system you operate—its limits, behaviors, and how to adapt when the unexpected hits.

Just as pilots, surgeons, and engineers succeed by mastering the unique systems they operate, we must do the same with our own brains. Understanding the way our minds work—its patterns, limits, and strengths—is essential to navigating challenges and performing at our highest level.

*Visual: A plane crash, surgeon performing surgery and a patient flatlining, a car crash. Illustrate that if we took the same approach in putting unqualified “drivers” behind the operating systems, we’d crash and burn. Get qualified to run your own operating system to see real results. Power up with the right set of tools.*

4. **SUCCESS IS NOT AN ORPHAN. EVERY LEGEND HAS A COACH.** 

**COACHING IN HIGH-LEVEL PERFORMANCE IS** **MULTI-DIMENSIONAL—IT SPANS PHYSICAL, MENTAL, EMOTIONAL, TACTICAL, AND EVEN SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT**

**Tom Brady’s** rise from a late-round draft pick to the most decorated quarterback in history wasn’t just fueled by drive—it was engineered through strategic guidance, constant feedback, and expert optimization of his mind and body. His journey proves that even the most disciplined competitor needs a team to unlock their full potential.

**Serena Williams** didn’t just outplay her opponents—she evolved faster, hit harder, and lasted longer because she embraced coaching at every level of her career. Behind every victory was a group of experts refining her technique, sharpening her strategy, and fortifying her resilience.

**Michael Jordan’s** greatness wasn’t automatic—it was forged through intense, targeted coaching that turned raw competitive fire into championship execution. With every leap forward, mentors were behind the scenes pushing him to lead harder, think deeper, and rise higher.

**Tiger Woods** dominated golf because he made growth a team sport—welcoming constant analysis, challenge, and support to perfect his game. His precision and longevity were the result of coaches who held him to standards even higher than his own.

*Visual: For each athlete, create their “trophy case” or Hall of Fame shrine comprised of their wins. Below each, include the list of their team of coaches by “type” (Support Staff, Team Behind Them, Inner Circle, Support system, Guides, Mentors, Specialists and Experts).*

**THE SHORT OF IT**

- Greatness is rarely a solo achievement   
- Narrative and research-backed case for why everyone needs a coach  
- Personal stories from world-class coaches across industries and disciplines   
- A cultural shift and reframe: Coaching isn’t a sign of weakness – it’s a path to greatness  
- Transferable lessons from one arena to another; the correlation sits within the principal, not the industry.  
- Coach: A dedicated individual to unlock your potential, overcome roadblocks, and grow with intention—at any stage, in any role.

**PURPOSE**

- Athletes and stars alike have been taking advantage of professional trainers for centuries, why isn’t it happening everywhere?   
  * People don’t get coached because they’re struggling—they get coached because they want to excel.  
- Tackle Mental Health head on  
  * EVERYONE has voices in their head. Let’s teach people how to live amongst those voices rather than be controlled by them.   
  * Create a safe space that allows your greatest assets to free themselves from their greatest competitor – themselves.   
- Create an environment that encourages and empowers individuals to be their best selves in every arena they play in (personal and professional lives inevitably and inherently bleed into one another – it’s impossible to ignore despite what our current way of being says)  
- Influence companies to bring the mission into their practice.   
  * Win-Win situation. Your people excelling on an individual level \= you excelling  
- Sever toxic and poisoned limbs holding you back   
  * If you wouldn’t invest in someone, they shouldn’t be on your team  
- Inspiration needs to be a principal  
- Open Door – Can’t operate on your own island  
- Be the change you want to see in the world

**THE PROBLEM**

***Are You Unlocking Your Employees’ Full Potential to Drive Revenue and Achieve Your Business Goals?***

The below address the challenges that managers often face in getting the most out of their employees, especially in high-demand careers.

By introducing personal business coaches, you can help resolve these issues, ensuring that employees receive individualized coaching and support to enhance both their personal growth and professional performance, ultimately benefiting both the employees and the organization.

***Critical Challenges:***

**Skills Gaps and Continuous Learning:** Rapid changes in technology and industry standards often create skills gaps. Managers are left trying to upskill employees but lack the resources or time to provide personalized coaching to address individual skill needs, making it difficult for employees to keep up with evolving expectations.

**Limited Time for Personalized Coaching:** Managers may recognize the need for coaching but struggle with the time constraints of their role. They often lack the bandwidth to provide tailored guidance and support to each employee, which leaves many employees feeling underdeveloped and unsupported in their career growth.

**Lack of Clear Development Pathways:** Managers often struggle to provide employees with clear and personalized growth opportunities. Without a structured roadmap for career development, employees may feel lost, unmotivated, or unclear about how to advance, leading to decreased productivity and engagement.

**Balancing Personal and Professional Growth:** High-demand employees often experience burnout because they are constantly pushed for productivity without consideration for their personal development. Managers may find it difficult to balance the needs of employees' work demands with their need for personal and professional growth, leading to lower job satisfaction and retention.

**Employee Retention and Engagement:** High-demand employees frequently jump to new opportunities if they feel stagnant or unsupported in their growth journey. Managers face challenges in retaining top talent when employees feel they’re not receiving the support they need to excel, which leads to high turnover rates and recruitment costs.

**TODAY | DISRUPTIVE IMPACT**

*What’s it costing you*

**Skills Gaps \= Lost Revenue:** Without continuous learning, your team falls behind, costing you business opportunities

**Missed Targets & Stagnant Growth:** Lack of clear development leads to unmet goals and stalled progress.

**Underperformance & Disengagement:** Limited coaching means untapped potential, leaving revenue on the table

**Burnout & Turnover:** Unbalanced work and growth opportunities increase burnout, lowering retention

**High Attrition Costs:** Without career support, top talent walks, increasing recruitment and training costs

---

**FUTURE | IMAGINE IF…**

* …employees had individually assigned coaches, tailored to their specific growth needs, from the perspective of a sales leader, portfolio managing director, and C-suite executives. 

***You could create the possibility for:***

* ***Overall Business Growth*** **| Increased Revenue & Sales Performance:** Personalized coaching drives sales teams to meet and exceed targets, fostering a culture of high performance.  
* ***Increased Individual Contribution |*** **Improved Employee Performance**: Employees who receive **personalized coaching** see **faster development** and measurable improvements in **revenue-generating activities**, from **sales performance** to **client relationships**.  
* **Higher Employee Retention & Engagement:** Tailored coaching ensures employees feel supported and valued, reducing turnover and fostering loyalty, which directly impacts bottom-line performance.  
* **Accelerated Skill Development & Innovation:** With individual coaching, employees are equipped to adapt quickly, increasing productivity and introducing innovative solutions that propel business growth.  
* **Stronger Leadership Pipeline:** Empowered employees grow into future leaders, creating a seamless pipeline to support business expansion and long-term strategic objectives.  
* **Improved Client Relationships & Portfolio Growth:** Personal business coaching enhances soft skills and strategic thinking, leading to stronger client relationships, increased trust, and ultimately, portfolio growth.  
* **Enhanced Decision-Making & Risk Management:** Managers and C-suite leaders benefit from employees who are more confident, strategic, and capable of making informed, high-stakes decisions that drive profitability.

This approach enables organizations to achieve their most critical goals—boosting revenue, enhancing client relationships, and developing future leaders—all while optimizing employee potential.

**THE GAP | What’s in the way?**  
*Current Environment is not adequate and lacking to meet the specific needs at the individual level – need to set employers and employees up for success. Training is not personalized, prioritized or built into career growth path. Key challenges associated with these three areas:*   
**Key Gaps in Standard Training & Why Your Team Needs Tailored Coaching**  
As a manager or employer, you face the responsibility of **driving team performance** and **business growth**, but you simply don’t have the bandwidth to provide **one-on-one development** for each employee. Standard training programs are **not enough** to maximize the potential of your team, especially when it comes to **critical areas that directly impact revenue** and **business outcomes**.   
By outsourcing the **personalized development** of your team to our matchmaking service, you’ll not only unlock the full potential of each employee, and also create a **high-performing workforce** that directly impacts **business growth**, **revenue**, and **long-term success**—without adding to your already demanding workload.  
**1\. LACK OF PERSONALIZATION IN STANDARD TRAINING**  
**GAP:** **Standard training programs** provide generalized solutions that don’t account for the **unique challenges** and **individual growth needs** of your employees. When you manage multiple people, it’s nearly impossible to give everyone the personalized attention they need to excel. As a result, employees may not meet performance targets or contribute fully to business growth.  
**WHY YOU NEED THIS SERVICE:** Through our **matchmaking service**, employees are paired with the **right coach** who specializes in their specific needs—whether that’s increasing **sales performance**, improving **soft skills**, or enhancing **leadership potential**. This one-on-one attention directly results in **faster development**, **greater productivity**, and a more **aligned** workforce, without you having to sacrifice your time.  
**2\. INADEQUATE SUPPORT FOR WELL-BEING AND RESILIENCE**

**GAP:** Managers often lack the resources or time to effectively support their teams' well-being, which is **critical for maintaining high performance**. When employees don't receive adequate support, they can experience **stress, burnout,** or **disengagement,** which can **ultimately affect productivity** and **impact** the **company’s financial outcomes.**  
**WHY YOU NEED THIS SERVICE:** Coaching takes an individual approach to help employees **manage stress, build emotional resilience,** and achieve a **healthier work-life balance**. With this personalized development, employees remain **focused, engaged,** and **productive**, which **directly enhances performance** and **team dynamics**.  
**3\. DIFFICULTY IN PROVIDING CONSISTENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND FOLLOW-THROUGH**  
**GAP:** Without **personalized coaching**, it’s hard to hold employees **accountable** and ensure they consistently implement what they’ve learned in standard training. As a result, the knowledge gained from training can be forgotten or misapplied, affecting **sales targets** or **client relationships**.  
**WHY YOU NEED THIS SERVICE:** Our coaches provide **consistent accountability**, ensuring employees follow through on goals, track progress, and adjust as needed. Whether they’re aiming to **close sales**, improve **client interactions**, or build **better leadership habits**, the **coaching structure** ensures employees stay on track, freeing you up to focus on your leadership responsibilities.  
**4\. INSUFFICIENT FOCUS ON SOFT SKILLS THAT DRIVE CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND BUSINESS GROWTH**  
**GAP:** In many industries, including asset management and financial services, **soft skills** such as **communication**, **negotiation**, and **relationship-building** are just as important—if not more—than technical skills. Yet, **standard training** often neglects this area, leaving employees underprepared to drive **client retention**, **new business development**, or **portfolio growth**.  
**WHY YOU NEED THIS SERVICE:** Coaches focus on building **soft skills**—such as **empathy**, **conflict resolution**, and **strategic communication**—which are vital for driving business growth. Employees will be better equipped to handle **client relationships**, **sales negotiations**, and **collaborations**, ultimately **boosting revenue** and **client satisfaction**, all while allowing you to stay focused on overall strategy.  
**5\. LACK OF DEVELOPMENT FOR EMPLOYEES WHO AREN’T IN LEADERSHIP ROLES BUT STILL IMPACT BUSINESS GROWTH**  
**GAP:** You may have high-performing **individual contributors**, like **sales reps** or **client-facing employees**, whose work directly impacts your revenue, but their growth isn’t being nurtured through standard leadership training programs. These employees need **individual coaching** to develop the skills that propel **business growth**—not just leadership skills.  
**WHY YOU NEED THIS SERVICE:** Our **matchmaking service** connects employees at **any level** with the right coach to focus on **personal development**, skill-building, and **strategic execution**. This tailored approach helps employees improve areas such as **client management**, **business development**, and **sales performance**, **driving revenue** and business expansion without needing to spend time managing their development yourself.  
**6\. INABILITY TO NAVIGATE CAREER TRANSITIONS OR JOB ROLE CHANGES**  
**GAP:** Employees experiencing **career transitions**, **role changes**, or personal challenges can struggle to perform at their best, leading to dips in productivity and overall business performance. As a manager, you may not have the time or expertise to guide them through these transitions effectively.  
**WHY YOU NEED THIS SERVICE:** Coaches specialize in helping employees **navigate transitions**, whether it's adapting to a new role, **managing work stress**, or overcoming **personal challenges**. This one-on-one coaching ensures that employees don’t miss a beat, keeping them **engaged** and **productive** as they adjust, which directly supports **revenue generation** and **business growth**.  
**7\. FOCUS ON LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT, NOT JUST SHORT-TERM TRAINING**  
**GAP:** Standard training programs typically focus on **short-term skills**, offering limited support for employees’ **long-term career development**. Employees may not have the guidance they need to set **ambitious, long-term goals** or **develop their full potential**, resulting in missed growth opportunities.  
**WHY YOU NEED THIS SERVICE:** Coaches work with employees to craft **personalized development plans**, focusing on their **long-term career trajectories**. This long-term perspective helps to keep employees **motivated**, **engaged**, and aligned with the company’s growth objectives, ensuring that **employee development** directly translates to **business expansion** and **sustained revenue growth**.  
**8\. EMPOWERING EMPLOYEES TO MAKE CONFIDENT, HIGH-IMPACT DECISIONS**  
**Gap:** Employees, especially in non-leadership roles, may lack the **confidence** or **decision-making skills** needed to make high-stakes decisions that impact business growth. This can lead to missed opportunities, particularly in roles that directly affect **client relationships**, **portfolio growth**, or **sales performance**.  
**WHY YOU NEED THIS SERVICE:** With **personalized coaching**, employees gain the **decision-making skills** and **confidence** to take ownership of important business decisions. Whether it’s managing **client portfolios**, **driving sales**, or **improving team collaboration**, coaching ensures employees are **empowered** to make strategic, revenue-generating choices.  
**WHAT WE DO**  
Traditional development programs often take a one-size-fits-all approach, which doesn't cater to the unique needs of individuals.   
Our services fill the critical gaps left by group training, connecting employees with coaches who focus exclusively on their unique needs and aspirations. Whether it's a rising star needing mentorship, a mid-career professional refining their leadership skills, or a senior leader managing complex challenges, personalized coaching provides the tools and accountability needed to unlock full potential.  
By investing in one-on-one development, organizationscan build stronger teams, increase employee satisfaction and retention, and drive long-term organizational success.

**THE SOLUTION | How can we solve for it?**  
The below process ensures a thorough, thoughtful, and client-focused approach to matching individuals with the right coaches.  
***The Matchmaking Journey***  
Many people spend their days walking, trotting or sprinting through life in a dark cloud; some aware of the lives they’re begrudgingly stuck in, most just passing through “OK” with it being good enough or “faking it till they make it.”   
As I experienced first-hand through my own personal and professional development journey, life can be so much more. The possibilities are limitless; and I want that for you. For you to live free from your fears, limiting beliefs and surrendering to lifeless contentment that your life is “good enough.”   
As your personal Matchmaker for your personal and professional development journey, we are here to uncover where you’re blocking yourself, open you up to the possibility that you can create the life you deserve and empower you to live up to your highest potential.  
Through this journey, we’ll address your personal and professional goals, what challenges stand in your way, and continue through a series of one-on-one sessions to partner you with the life changing resources available at your fingertips.

**WHY MATCHEDWELL 🡪 THE MISSING LINK**  
*High-impact coaching isn’t just about individual growth—it’s about shaping the culture your business runs on. That’s where MatchedWell leads.*  
In performance-driven environments, results are expected—but the conditions that produce them are often ignored. Coaching without oversight becomes fragmented. Culture without structure breaks under pressure.  
**MatchedWell owns the full process—so coaching delivers, and culture compounds.**

* **Builds the Winning Formula:** We help you cultivate the behavioral and leadership standards your firm needs to scale.  
* **Drives Firmwide Consistency:** Coaches are aligned to your values, language, and operating cadence—ensuring your people grow in sync with the business.  
* **Ensures Strategic Fit:** Each engagement is tailored to business goals and reinforced with accountability.  
* **Protects Leadership Focus:** We handle the execution—matching, tracking, and managing progress—so you stay focused on performance.  
* **Strengthens the Cultural Core:** Coaching becomes part of how you develop people, not a bolt-on benefit.

MatchedWell isn’t just overseeing coaching—we’re helping you engineer a culture that sustains performance at scale.

# **DIFFERENTIATORS** *MatchedWell leads a targeted, collaborative process to cultivate your firm’s winning formula—aligning culture with execution. Leadership stays focused on running the business, driving performance, and delivering results—while top talent is supported and operating at peak.*  **Fuel next-level performance** by shifting mindset and reaffirm that your talent is **heard, supported** and **valued**.

## **Individualized, Not Pre-Packaged** Coaches are sourced for each person’s unique needs – Objective and unbound by coaching agency benches, methodology or rigid models.

**Precision Matching, Built for Impact**  
Deep intake and performance alignment ensure the right coach – no sifting, no guessing.  
**Leadership Time, Fully Protected**  
The full process is managed end-to-end; leaders stay focused while talent gets fully supported.  
**Strategic Alignment, Not Generic Guidance**  
Coaches are briefed on company goals, culture, and context – so coaching drives execution, not just insight.   
**Oversight That Delivers Results**  
Progress is tracked, traction is measured, and outcomes are reviewed – because development should move the needle.  
**High-Touch, Executive-Ready Support**  
No platform, no dashboards—just curated, white-glove placement and  coaching for top performers.

**WINNING FORMULA**

**Extreme Talent Density**  
Hire only the Best: Top performers elevate each other. Concentrated excellence drives compounding gains in output, insight, decision-making and innovation.

**Uncompromising Investment In Development**   
Grow exceptional talent: Don’t just hire talent—sharpen it. Continuous learning ensures adaptability in fast-moving markets and strengthens long-term retention.

**Radical Candor And Transparency**   
Demand honest feedback and intellectual openness: Eliminate political behavior, surface better ideas faster, and create a resilient decision-making ecosystem.

**Meritocracy Over Hierarchy**  
Reward results over tenure or titles: Unlock potential at every level and ensure ideas rise based on merit—not status—accelerating innovation and accountability.

**Resilience As Performance Multiplier**   
Human strength drives results: Well-being isn’t a perk; it’s an operational imperative. Clarity, composure, and endurance keep talent performing under pressure.
