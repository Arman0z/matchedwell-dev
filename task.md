I want you to go through and replace all of the copy in the website with better copy. I want you to formulate the copy yourself using assets like the @governing_doc.md and I want you to go in and actually replace all of the copy, being sure to think hard about the actual structure of the website and where the copy fits in. Story-wise, on the website for example, every section has a different message it's trying to tell.

- The "Why Coaching" section is trying to initially sell the user on the idea of coaching. It uses three primary points to do this: 1. Limited bandwidth 2. Talent retention 3. Revenue targets
  Note that there is a front and a back side to each of these three points, so you should formulate different copy and taglines for both the front and the back side. The front side should be more focused on the problem, and the back side should be more focused on the solution.
- The "Who we are" section Focuses on the four-step approach by matching well for solving this problem and for getting great results. Piece this together and learn from the @governing_doc.md to learn more.
- The "for business" section Is about the value proposition for businesses It also follows a 3-bullet approach. Fill this in with more accurate bullet copy and taglines.
- The "for coaches" section is similar where you need to fill in the value proposition for coaches. Use the three bullet approach with more accurate bullet copy and taglines.

Make all of the copy fit really nicely on the page and is super abundantly clear and obvious when first read.
